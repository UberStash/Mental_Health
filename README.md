# Mental_Health

Welcome To Mental Health the app for the medical industry. 

This app is simple to use it is targeted in our case for the mental health portion of the medical industry.

Installing this and running it is simple: 

Clone the repo to your local machine, run npm install in both the client and server side folders.

Set up a database we use postgres but you may use others but may need to change SQL statments. 

You will need to use your own API keys for google twilio and news and place them in your env file server side refrencing the env example.

You will also need to specificy your port database info etc here remember to follow the env example. 

Once all is packages are installed start up the client server using npm start and the server side using npm run dev.

Thank you, This app is a work in progress although it is functioning there will be updates made to this in the future.
